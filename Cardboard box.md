##  Find the Hidden Tresure in the Enchanted Forest with a....Cardboard box?

**Sigint:** "Uh, Y/N... What are you doing?"

**Y/N:** "I'm in a box."

**Sigint:** "A cardboard box? Why are you...?"

**Y/N:** "I dunno. I was just looking at it and I suddenly got this urge to get inside. No, not just an urge—more than that. It was my destiny to be here; in the box."

**Sigint:** "Destiny...?"

**Y/N:** "Yeah. And then when I put it on, I suddenly got this feeling of inner peace. I can't put it into words. I feel... safe. Like this is where I was meant to be. Like I'd found the key to true happiness."

**Sigint:** "..."

**Y/N:** "Does any of that make sense?"

**Sigint:** "Not even a little."

**Y/N:** "You should come inside the box... Then you'll know what I mean."

**Sigint:** "Man, I don't wanna know what you mean! Between you and Para-Medic, is everyone but me that is hooked up with the Major strange?!"

**Y/N:** "..."

**Sigint:** "Yeah, well, anyway, I suppose even that dumb box might make a decent disguise if you wear it inside a building."

You run into the forest with a cardboard box.

You are promtly stabbed to death by 20 goblins and they steal your box.

Well what did you expect would happen?

You're upset you got the bad ending?

Well then pick a smarter option next time you idiot!

Sorry that was a little harsh.

Anyways you should play **Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater**.
