##  Get your Box Back in the Enchanted Forest

No... You can't go out like this. You can see the 20 goblins, and your beloved box, run off in the distance. They're far but still in view. There's still hope! You crawl in their direction.

**Y/N:** "Hey!"

All 20 goblins simultaneously stop, turn around... and point and laugh. You immediately drop and fade away.

You tried at least.
