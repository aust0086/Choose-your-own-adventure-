##  Find the Hidden Tresure in the Enchanted Forest with a stapler and a fast Tongue

The griffin raises his claw and is about to kill you with one slash, and then you scream out "WAIT!".

The Griffin is confused, as people usually just accept their fate, so he decides to hear you out. Thinking quickly, you say, "If you let me live, then I can get to the treasure, and with the money from it, I can buy an elixir to help you be one beast instead of many." The griffin thinks about it, then goes to claw at you again. "OKAY! You can stay as you are! Do you want anything?".

The griffin thinks again and then flies away. Confused, you continue on with the adventure. You encounter many more beasts, but when they are about to attack you, the griffen comes back and keeps you safe from them.

When you get to the treasure, there is a wizard waiting, and you ask why the Griffin let you go. He says that because of your kindness in thinking about the Griffin, he spared you and wanted you to get the treasure. So with your new treasure, the Griffen takes you back to town, and you are free to start a newer, richer life.
