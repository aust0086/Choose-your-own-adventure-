##  Find the Hidden Tresure in the Enchanted Forest with a stapler

You spot some type of clamp and fastening device, when a whisper at the bottom of your goblet tells you it is called a stapler. Feeling drawn to it, you take it and brave the forest. You slack the stapler open and point as you take your first step through the trees. Almost immediately, a giant griffin lands before you. After inching a threatening step closer, you squeeze the stapler down, shooting a thin bracket of metal that bounces off the griffin's nose...

He hates your pathetic attempt and kills you in one slash of his claw.
